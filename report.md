## Introduction

This research report explores the applications and potential implications of machine learning technology on the lives of human beings. It is diveded into two parts: Part I delves briefly into the theoretical aspects of the technology, and Part II demonstrates the use of a novel machine learning model, called YOLO, to detect objects in an image or in video footage.

## Part I: Machine Learning

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that applies algorithms and mathematical models to data in order to perform tasks based on general training, without requiring explicit instructions from a programmer to do so. Typically, machine learning is used to make predictions and inference based on patterns in the existing, or "training," data.

The ideas of machine learning have been around since the 1950s. However, only recently did it become feasible to apply machine learning models to large datasets in a practical way.
